Throughout my programming journey, I have actively pursued opportunities to gain hands-on experience that align with my passions and career goals.

My professional aspirations are centered in Data Science in which I am driven by the potential of this field to streamline daily tasks and solve complex challenges. My current goals include joining research labs and securing internships, where I can contribute to cutting-edge projects while working alongside innovative and supportive professionals.

As a third-year Data Science student at UC San Diego, I am keen to bridge the gap between academic knowledge and real-world applications. Despite my early stage in the field, I am dedicated to seizing every opportunity for growth.
